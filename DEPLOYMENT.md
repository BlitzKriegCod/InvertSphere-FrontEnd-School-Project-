# InventSphere Deployment Guide

This document outlines the steps to deploy the InventSphere application using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your deployment server
- Docker Compose installed (optional, but recommended)
- Basic knowledge of Docker and containerization

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the project root directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project
   ```

2. Build and start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will build the Docker image and start the container in detached mode.

3. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

4. To stop the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Option 2: Using Docker Directly

1. Navigate to the project root directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t inventsphere-app .
   ```

3. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name inventsphere inventsphere-app
   ```

4. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

5. To stop the container:
   ```bash
   docker stop inventsphere
   docker rm inventsphere
   ```

## Environment Variables

You can customize the application behavior using environment variables. Add them to the docker-compose.yml file or pass them using the `-e` flag with `docker run`.

Example environment variables:
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production` for production deployment
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Backend API URL (if applicable)

## Production Deployment Considerations

### 1. SSL/TLS Configuration

For production, you should set up SSL/TLS using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Traefik.

Example Nginx configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### 2. Container Orchestration

For more complex deployments, consider using:
- Kubernetes
- Docker Swarm
- AWS ECS/EKS

### 3. CI/CD Integration

Set up a CI/CD pipeline using:
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI
- Jenkins
- CircleCI

Example GitHub Actions workflow:
```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          push: true
          tags: your-registry/inventsphere:latest
      - name: Deploy to server
        # Add deployment steps here
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Container exits immediately**:
   - Check the container logs: `docker logs inventsphere`
   - Ensure the Next.js build completed successfully

2. **Application is not accessible**:
   - Verify the container is running: `docker ps`
   - Check if the port mapping is correct: `docker port inventsphere`
   - Make sure no firewall is blocking the port

3. **Build fails**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in package.json
   - Check for syntax errors in the code
   - Verify that Node.js version in Dockerfile matches your development environment

## Monitoring and Logging

For production deployments, consider setting up:
- Prometheus for metrics
- Grafana for visualization
- ELK stack for logging
- Sentry for error tracking

## Backup Strategy

Implement a backup strategy for any persistent data:
- Database backups
- Volume backups
- Configuration backups

## Security Considerations

1. Never store sensitive information in the Docker image
2. Use environment variables for configuration
3. Regularly update base images and dependencies
4. Scan your images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy or Clair
5. Implement proper access controls for your Docker registry
